# Aircraft-Battle
This is a simple aircraft battle game programmed in python. I followed the instructions in python crash course book,
and made some simple changes like background picture and the icon of the aircraft.

The material for the icon of the aircraft was posted at the same time with the code.

This project is just recorded my first post on github.
